# Intro-To-Programming-Final
With my final project I developed a text based adventure game based on the show "The Mandalorian" In this game you progress through 10 galaxies with the hope of rescuing "Baby Yoda" just like in the TV show. Along the way you will come across some enemies so beware! more in the READ.me


The Requirements for this project is as follows

(1)  Your adventurer must have a name, keep track of how many trinkets they've collected, and their personal resource. They can have other things as well, but these are required.
- Trinket examples from previous games: Eggo waffles, holiday gifts, and Subway endorsement checks.
- Personal resource examples from previous games: time to work on programming assignments, health points, and time for preparing dinner.

(2)  Your enemies must have a name, an introduction (e.g. "It's Aaron Burr! He'll kill your political aspirations and then shoot you in the back!"), and a personal resource that you can reduce when "attacking". Again, other things are also possible and encouraged, but these are required.
- Enemy examples from previous games: sharks, nosy neighbors, Krampus, and Kylo Ren

(3) Your adventurer must progress towards something in a 'straight line' (no mazes), no more than 10 steps/moves/transitions/time slices away from the start.

(4) With each step of progress, it must be possible for the adventurer to collect some amount of your chosen random trinket, or be attacked. Other things can happen as well, but those two must be possible

(5)  There must be at least three possible enemies you encounter. You should be using some element of random chance so it is possible that on a particular play of the game we might not encounter one or more of the enemies, but there should be at least three possibilities.

(6)  The game must end. It cannot be infinite. Your adventurer may make it to the goal or not make it to the goal, but the game must end at some point without errors (i.e., no Exceptions from Python to end the game).

(7) Once the game is over, you must at least output the total number of your chosen trinkets the adventurer collected and the final amount of their personal resource. You can output other things as well as they are relevant to your adventure game, but trinket count and personal resource amount are required.


As an adventurer, you will be concerned with three things: 
(1) reaching some stated goal, 
(2) collecting some random trinket (e.g., gold pieces), 
(3) protecting some personal resource (e.g., keeping a health level above 0).

Your game must have the adventurer progress towards some goal (e.g., get to a treasure chest), 
within 10 "steps" (e.g., step to the treasure chest) by making choices. 

As progress is made though there should always be at least two possible outcomes:  
(1)you find a random amount of the trinket or 
(2) you are confronted by an enemy.
